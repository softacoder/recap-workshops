Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) JS is a JavaScript editor that evaluates your code as you type and gives you the power of time travel all while making your experiments easily accessible by you or whoever you chose to share them with.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
